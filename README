# After you run the program, the program will automatically run the command line for setting the environment. Use the following possible commands to define your environment. Or type "show" to view the environment.

>> def point A (0,0,0)
#Define point A as 0 0 0

>> def point B (1,1,1)
#Define point B as 1 1 1

>> def edge AB A B
#Define edge AB as the edge connecting point A and point B

>> del point A
#Delete point A

>> def point C (2,2,2)
#Define point C as 2 2 2

>> def point D (3,2,1)
#Define point D as 3 2 1

>> def face BCD B C D
#Define face BCD as the triangle connecting point B and point C and point D

>> def mesh wall1 wall1
#Define a mesh by "wall1.off" in the Input folder

>> show point
#The environment contains:
#point B: 1 1 1
#point C: 2 2 2
#point D: 3 2 1

>> show edge
#The environment contains:
#edge AB
#edge B_C
#edge C_D
#edge D_B

>> show face
#The environment contains:
#face BCD

>> run
#Simple find path algorithm with epsilon = 0.05

>> run 0.005
#Simple find path algorithm with epsilon = 0.005

>> exit
#Find path algorithm terminates.
