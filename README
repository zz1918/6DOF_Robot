#This is the project for SSS framework on 6DOF robot.

#To compile this file, please follow these steps:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../main
cmake --build .

#To run the program, type:

Debug/main.exe

#or

Debug/main

#or

./main

#After you run the program without argument, the program will automatically run the command line for setting the environment. Use the following possible commands to define your environment.

>> def point A (0,0,0)
#Define point A as 0 0 0

>> def point B (1,1,1)
#Define point B as 1 1 1

>> def edge AB A B
#Define edge AB as the edge connecting point A and point B

>> del point A
#Delete point A

>> def point C (2,2,2)
#Define point C as 2 2 2

>> def point D (3,2,1)
#Define point D as 3 2 1

>> def face BCD B C D
#Define face BCD as the triangle connecting point B and point C and point D

>> show point
#The environment contains:
#point B: 1 1 1
#point C: 2 2 2
#point D: 3 2 1

>> show edge
#The environment contains:
#edge AB
#edge B_C
#edge C_D
#edge D_B

>> show face
#The environment contains:
#face BCD

>> run
#Simple find path algorithm with epsilon = 0.05

>> run 0.005
#Simple find path algorithm with epsilon = 0.005

>> exit
#Find path algorithm terminates.
